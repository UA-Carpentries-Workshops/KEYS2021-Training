  This resource is maintained by the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  organization (SWC). Part of the <a href="https://carpentries.org/about/">The Carpentries</a>, organization, Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  SWC workshops are hands-on and cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
